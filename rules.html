          <p>Set up - In Texas Hold’em, there are three roles that rotate clockwise after each game: Dealer, Left Blind, and Right Blind.</p>
          <p>Dealer - Before the game begins an initial Dealer must be chosen. To do so, every player is given a card from a shuffled deck and whoever receives the highest card becomes the first Dealer. Ties are broken by a repeated deal. The Dealer is given a token or button to illustrate the title. The initial Dealer shuffles the deck and the player clockwise to them cuts it. The Dealer will then advance the steps of play as discussed below.</p>
          <p>Left Blind - The Left Blind is the player clockwise to the dealer. They make the initial bet before anybody gets their cards.</p>
          <p>Right Blind -The Right Blind is the player clockwise to the Left Blind. They must double the bet of the Left Blind.</p>
          <p>How to Play - After the Blinds have added to the pot, the Dealer passes out two cards to everybody in play. In Texas Hold’em, players have five moves they can make with each round: Fold, Check, Bet, Call, and Raise.</p>
          <p>Fold - To fold, players surrender their hand, losing whatever bets they may have made in the game the pot</p>
          <p>Check - To check, players pass on the option to make a bet. Checks can only happen if no bets had been made in the round thus far.</p>
          <p>Bet - To bet, players put in any amount of money they think matches the worth of their hand into the pot. The first bet determines the stakes of the round</p>
          <p>Call - To call, players make a bet equal to the amount of the previous bet.</p>
          <p>Raise - To raise, players make a bet larger than the amount of the previous bet.</p>
          <p>Rounds - In Texas Hold’em, there are five rounds to a game: Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn, River, and Showdown.</p>
          <p>Pre-Flop - After the Dealer has passed out two cards to everyone, the player clockwise to the Right Blind has the option to fold, call or raise the previous bet. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table.</p>
          <p>Flop - At the start of the Flop round, the Dealer places three community cards upright in the middle of the table. Normal play then proceeds starting with the player clockwise from the Dealer.</p>
          <p>Turn/Fourth Street - At the start of the Turn Round, or Fourth Street, the Dealer places a fourth card in the community.</p>
          <p>River/Fifth Street - At the start of the River Round, the Dealer places a fifth and final card in the community.</p>
          <p>Showdown - If there are still players in the game after the River Round, players must over turn their cards for all to see with the highest hand taking the pot. At the end of the round, the Dealer, Left Blind and Right Blind rotate clockwise and gameplay begins again.</p>
